* EECS 600 Project
** Rewrite a minimum stageros to move blocks around and scan them with lidar
*** TODO Load a world file with a robot with a lidar.
*** TODO Access the lidar output, write it to file.
*** TODO Add simple block model to the simulation.
*** TODO Read from A-Z.csv and load those blocks into simulation.
*** TODO Change angle, distance, rotation, size, and noise level or blocks
**** noise added to each vertex -- angle - uniform, radius -gaussian w/ std = noise level.
*** TODO Cycle through
**** block type
**** angle (-90 on the +y-axis, 0 on the x-axis, 90 on the -y-axis)
**** distance (from lidar)
**** rotation (angle with respect to angle above)
**** size (1 = text height of 1 m. Actual text is sometimes a bit larger.)
**** noise level (angle - uniform(0,180), distance - normal(0,noise level))
*** TODO At each instance in the cycle above, record a scan
*** TODO Save data to a .csv or binary file
**** Data structure: block type, angle, distance, rotation, size, noise level, [scan] 

** Write TensorFlow DCNN

* Useful Commands
M-shift-RET -- Make new TODO item
C-c C-t -- Mark TODO item as done with timestamp
shift-TAB -- cycle through heading expansion levels
