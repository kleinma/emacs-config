TODO List:
x1. Attempt to move robot in simulation through code.

2. Attempt to change robot size in simulation through code.
- Use SetGeom

3. Change 'origin' of robot.
- If the origin of the robot is set, will it scale when the size is changed? I should test this.
- Currently it does not. Changing the size does wierd things with the origin of the robot. This needs tested.

4. Make some robot shapes and move them around.
